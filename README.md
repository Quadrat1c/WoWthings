## Damage
Like the other rogue specs, Subtlety’s “rotation” is a priority system based on generating and spending Combo Points. There are various factors that influence when to build and when to spend, including cooldown availability and buff time, which legendaries you are using, and how many targets you are facing. Subtlety is very reliant on precise timing, understanding how your abilities synergize, and the ability to plan your approach to the fight to optimize use of all abilities.

Using a few ability macros will go a long way towards optimizing your timing (see Macros section) and a good understanding of the DfA Combo (see Combo Point Spenders section) is key to achieving the best from your Subtlety rogue.

If you are using the The First of the Dead legendary gloves, your Combo Point generation will be affected to a great degree. You will notice that the Opener and Rotation sections are divided to accommodate this.

### Pre-Pull
Potion of Prolonged Power 1 second remaining on the pull timer
Shadow Blades 0 seconds remaining on the pull timer

### Opener
Your opener will be slightly different depending on whether or not you are using The First of the Dead.

With The First of the Dead

Shadowstrike
Nightblade
Symbols of Death
Shadow Dance + Shadowstrike
Eviscerate

### Cooldowns
Symbols of Death on cooldown
Shadow Blades on cooldown
Goremaw's Bite if you have 3 or fewer combo points and less than 50 energy
Vanish on cooldown or save for a Symbols of Death and Death from Above combo (see below)

### Combo Point Generators
Outside Shadow Dance

Backstab if there is 1 target
Shuriken Storm if there are 2+ targets
Inside Shadow Dance

Shadowstrike if there are 2 or fewer targets
Shuriken Storm if there are 3+ targets

### Combo Point Spenders
In general you want to finish at 5+ while Shadow Blades is up and at 6 when Shadow Blades is down.

Nightblade:

Keep Nightblade up on your primary target at all times
Refresh in pandemic window or
Force a refresh to ensure Nightblade will last all of Symbols of Death if Symbols of Death is about come off cool down
Death from Above:

DfA Combo: use Death from Above and then spam Shadow Dance while you are in the air. The idea is to have the Eviscerate part of Death from Above benefit from Shadow Dance.

Save Death from Above for when Symbols of Death comes off cooldown. Have at least 1 charge of Shadow Dance available.

Shadow Dance can be used prior to Death from Above if there are 5 or more targets around you and your goal is do maximize area damage and not focus on a single target.

Eviscerate:

Used as a filler finisher as long as Nightblade and Death from Above conditions are not met
Can use at 4+ combo points when you have 4 or more targets to hit with Shuriken Storm

### Rotation
With The First of the Dead
Symbols of Death
Eviscerate at 5-6 Combo Points
Backstab
Without The First of the Dead
At 5 or 6 combo points

Symbols of Death
Death from Above + Shadow Dance (DfA Combo)
Shadowstrike
Shadowstrike
Eviscerate
Shadowstrike
With Vanish
Symbols of Death
Vanish
Shadowstrike
Then following up with Death from Above

Death from Above + Shadow Dance (DfA Combo)
Shadowstrike
Shadowstrike
Eviscerate
Shadowstrike
Notes:

Finality: Eviscerate is not as important as the timing and uptime of Symbols of Death.
In multi target situations, due to the use of Shuriken Storm, Shadow Dance will cooldown  faster than normal.
